Lab - mycat
===========

Rewrite the `cat2.c` program by using `read`, `write`, `open` and `close` instead of their library equivalents.

Then, generate a report with performance metrics between the existing `cat` command  and your `mycat`.
The format of the report is free, you can add charts or whatever helps to understand the speed of both approaches.

General instructions
--------------------
1. Don't forget to do a `pull origin master` and then create the lab's branch.
2. Submit your code to your personal fork / branch.
3. Use the `cat2.c` file for your code.
4. Have fun and don't forget the [next section](#how-to-submit-your-work).
